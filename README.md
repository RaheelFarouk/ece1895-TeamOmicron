Within Hardware, you can find Altium files, guides, and datasheets.

## Enclosure
Within Enclosure, you can find all of our Corel Draw, SolidWorks, and Fusion360 files. These include the folders for the full enclosure, knob, lever, and logos. 

## Software
Within Software, you can find our audio file and code folders containing the main code, peripheral tests, and our first team assignment using Git.
